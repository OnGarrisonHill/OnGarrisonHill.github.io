## On: How to send your work
  ### Selecting Work
- We want your best, weirdest, most beautiful, soul-crushing, curious, confusing, evocative, angry, forlorn, impassioned work. Whatever that means for you. We want the grit, the art, the love-despite-it-all of seacoast New England. We want the weird corners, inside-out, different in the moonlight places.

- We accept:
  - photos,
  poetry,
  digital art,
  prose,
  memoirs,
  short fiction,
  lyrics,
  playlists of local bands,
  collage,
  painting,
  drawing,
  lists,
  whatever.
  
  - themed and unthemed submissions, as long as it hasn't been previously published.
- We do not accept
   - hate speech, slander, excessive gore, sexually explicit, or harmful content. We do not accept work that is generated, prompted or aided by AI models. "But I don't have anyone to edit for me" "I'm not very good at drawing". Shut uuuuuuuup. The point isn't to be good, the point is to do it. Tasteful innuendo and foul language are up to the writer's discretion.
 - We reserve the right to request authors change aspects of the piece (language, content) we find to be in poor taste. We're not prudes, but lets mind the line.
