## On: How to send your work
  ### Selecting Work
- We want your best, weirdest, most beautiful, soul-crushing, curious, confusing, evocative, angry, forlorn, impassioned work. Whatever that means for you. We want the grit, the art, the love-despite-it-all of seacoast New England. We want the weird corners, inside-out, different in the moonlight places.

- We accept:
  - photos,
  poetry,
  digital art,
  prose,
  memoirs,
  short fiction,
  lyrics,
  playlists of local bands,
  collage,
  painting,
  drawing,
  lists,
  whatever.
  
  - themed and unthemed submissions, as long as it hasn't been previously published.
- We do not accept
   - hate speech, slander, excessive gore, sexually explicit, or harmful content.
   - work that is generated, prompted or aided by AI models.
     - "But I don't have anyone to edit for me" "I'm not very good at drawing". Shut uuuuuuuup. The point isn't to be good, the point is to do it.
 - Tasteful innuendo and foul language are up to the writer's discretion.
 - We reserve the right to request authors change aspects of the piece (language, content) we find to be in poor taste. We're not prudes, but lets mind the line.
