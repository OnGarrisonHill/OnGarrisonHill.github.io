## On: Making this magazine
- This magazine is for the tiny nowhere dressed in red brick and coastal homes reclusive authors spend two months of the year in. The art that comes from the year-rounders who love it here or hate it here or can't make up their minds about it is what makes it what it is. If you're a 67 year old woman who writes poetry and only talks to birds or a 20-something pseudo-punk angry at everything and spray painting your furniture about it, your art deserves a home. This magazine is a hodge-podge, garbage heap, running start, love letter to the place some of us can't wait to get away from. The truth is there's more than nothing here, there's only next-to-nothing, an important distinction. This magazine was born out of a need for something to do (and something to do with all the cool shit everybody makes). This magazine is a vessel to enjoy the view from on Garrison Hill.
