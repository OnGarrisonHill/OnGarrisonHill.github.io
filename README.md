## On: How to send your work
  ### Selecting Work
  '
    We want your best, weirdest, most beautiful, soul-crushing, curious, confusing, evocative, angry, forlorn, impassioned work. Whatever that means for you. We want the grit, the art, the love-despite-it-all of seacoast New England. We want the weird corners, inside-out, different in the moonlight places. We accept photos, poetry, digital art, prose, memoirs, short fiction, lyrics, playlists of local bands, collage, painting, drawing, lists, whatever. We accept themed and unthemed submissions, as long as it hasn't been previously published. We do not accept hate speech, unamusing conspiracy theories, slander, excessive gore, sexually explicit, or harmful content. Tasteful innuendo and foul language are up to the writer's discretion. We reserve the right to request authors change aspects of the piece (language, content) we find to be in poor taste. We're not prudes, but lets mind the line.
