<h2>On: How to send your work</h2>
 <h3>Selecting Work</h3>
  <p>
   We want your best, weirdest, most beautiful, soul-crushing, curious, confusing, evocative, angry, forlorn, impassioned work. Whatever that means for you. We want the grit, the art, the love-despite-it-all of seacoast New England. We want the weird corners, inside-out, different in the moonlight places.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  We accept:
  <li> photos</li>
  <li>poetry</li>
  <li>digital art</li>
  <li>prose</li>
  <li>memoirs</li>
  <li>short fiction</li>
  <li>lyrics</li>
  <li>playlists of local bands</li>
  <li>collage</li>
  <li>painting</li>
  <li>drawing</li>
  <li>lists</li>
  <li>whatever.</li>
  <li>themed and unthemed submissions, as long as it hasn't been previously published.</li>

  We do not accept:
  <li>hate speech</li>
  <li>slander</li> 
  <li>excessive gore</li>
  <li>sexually explicit or harmful content.</li> 
  <li>work that is generated, prompted or aided by AI models.</li>
  
  <p>
    "But I don't have anyone to edit for me" "I'm not very good at drawing". Shut uuuuuuuup. AI is loser shit. The point isn't to be good, the point is to do it. Making "bad" art is as good for your soul as making "good" art. Make art out of garbage if you want, we might even take that too. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Innuendo, crude humor, and "foul" language are up to the artists discretion.
