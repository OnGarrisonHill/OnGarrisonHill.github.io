  Good. Welcome home.
  </p>

  <p>
  On: Garrison Hill is a literary magazine devoted to collecting your scraps of bizarre, off-kilter, rough, niche, good, bad, and Dirty Dovah. We want your thoughts On: Everything.Your words are precious and strange, your art is necessary, your home is the Northeast half of Nowhere. 
    Send us your fiction too weird to fit anywhere else, your poems with an ungodly amount of half-rhyme, your ballpoint pen drawings on the back of a CVS receipt.  We want catharsis and art from human hands because generation is not creation, because art is 
    human, and because hoarding is fun. The goal of this mag is to capture every angle of seacoast New England, not just the Land's End spread. We want you: local artists, local art.
